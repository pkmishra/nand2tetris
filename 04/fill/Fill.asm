// Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// When a key is pressed (any key), the program blackens the screen,
// i.e. writes "black" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully black as long as the key is pressed.
// When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen, i.e. writes
// "white" in every pixel;
// the screen should remain fully clear as long as no key is pressed.

// Put your code here.
// While any key is pressed make screen black
// As soon as key is released make it white
// 1 row = 16 X 32 = 512 pixel - total 16 rows
//Each row in the physical screen,starting at the screenâ€™s top left corner, is represented in the RAM by 32 consecu-tive 16-bit words
